# analytics_roadmap


- Creation of a comprehensive Curve analytics platform with real time dashboards for all pools across multiple chains

- Open-source the codebase to encourage community participation and external contributions
- Interface with the Curve team, DAO, integrating protocols and users


## 1. Dedicated analytics platform

We have developed an MVP for what a future dashboard would look like for a standard Curve pool. This real-time dashboard allows allows users to follow trading activity, including miner extractable value (MEV) activity, monitor the historical performance of the pool by displaying assets balances, price fluctuations, and bonding curves.  We are committed to working closely with the Curve core team and the research and risk team to continue improving and enhancing these dashboards. Our current roadmap/task list for improvements is as follows:

- Making the MVP dashboard available for all mainnet Curve pools
- Expanding historical data availability to the lifetime of each pool
- Adding new charts to the current dashboard: histogram of price ranges to assess historical peg and volatility of a pair, comparison of LP token price performance vs holding vs xy=k with IL calculator, market depth chart
- Extending support to pools on all chain where Curve is deployed
- Optimizing the user interface for a better and more user-friendly experience
- Offering alert and export features
